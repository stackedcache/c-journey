# POINTERS FOUNDATION 

Pointers are fundamental in C programming. A pointer is a variable which stores the memory address of another variable as its 
value.

**Pointers allow for:** 
- Efficient memory management 
- Dynamic allocation 
- Direct hardware manipulation. 
- Pass function references dynamically 

This section provides a hands-on approach to mastering pointers through structured notes, example programs, and challenges. 


## PREREQUISITES 

- Before diving into pointers, you should be familiar with: 
    - Basic C syntax (functions, variable types, control flow)
    - Arrays and Memory Layout 
    - Basic operations on data types


## HOW TO USE THIS SECTION? 

- Start with pointers_notes.md --> Get a theoretical understanding.
- Run and experiment with the example programs while learning (pointer_arithmetic.c, function-pointer-example.c, etc.)
- Try the challenges in pointers_challenges.md and write your own implementations without checking mine or other code.
