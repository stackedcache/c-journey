# BASICS - Brick by Brick...

Laying the foundation of C programming, one concept at a time, with disciplined practice and clean workflow //
закладываю основу программирования на С -- шаг за шагом, с практикой и чётким процессом.

In this section I will demonstrate basic C concepts. 

Topics to include variable types, arrays and strings, control flow, functions, loops, and pointers.

For each topic, I will work with AI to study the concepts, and then have AI assign me challenges.

I will work to complete the challenges without looking at notes, or only referring to syntax when needed.


## Bonus Learning

This project also aims to sharpen essential dev workflows. 

I will be using Git for proper version control, Vim for efficient editing, and Make for clean and automated build compilation. 

I will slowly work to add in Russian comments here and there as well. 

Adding Russian comments will help me get used to typing in Russian on a keyboard, as well as repeated exposure to common words.
