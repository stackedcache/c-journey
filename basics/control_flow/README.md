# It's Getting Real...

In this section you will find three .c programs, and another .md file named 'challenges.md'

The challenges file lists each "challenge" I went through after doing basic study on how program control flow works in C. 

It also has notes I took along the way about what problems I had and how I fixed them. 

It may not be useful to anyone and has a lot of 'junk' -- but it does show my mindset and I'll leave it for historical reference.

## THE BIGGEST BREAKTHROUGH

The biggest breakthrough for me was using GDB (combined with help from AI) to determine the location of a return address after I set up a vulnderable function 
in the jump-table-hacking.c program. 

In Substack I have written more about this. You can read that post [here](https://stackedcache.substack.com/p/hijacking-execution-flow). 

I don't fully understand it yet -- the program was written and compiled in a vulnerable way -- and this was much more advanced than basic control flow in C.

Still, it was an invaluable experience and as mentioned in my previous [Substacks](https://stackedcache.substack.com/), exposure is all that matters sometimes on the path to mastery.

At least that's what I think for now.

Until next time, thanks for stopping by!
